		<h1>Welcome to the FUSD Speaking Indicator System</h1>
		<hr>
		<br>
		<center>
			<a class="button-darker pure-button" href="/speak">Click here to indicate whether you would like to speak!</a> 
			<a class="button-darker pure-button" href="/admin">Click here to go to the admin page!</a>
		</center>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>How it works:</h3>
		<p>If you wish to speak, click on the link for the speak page. Enter in your name and whether you want to speak, and hit submit. </p>
		<p>If you wish to moderate the system, click on the link for the admin page. The page will populate with everyone who sent a request so far. You may refresh the page to update who wants to speak or not if someone submits after you load the page. If you want to reset the system, hit reset, and wait for everyone to submit before you refresh the page.</p>
		<p>Special thanks to the Fremont Unified School District for giving us the opportunity to work on this web application!</p>
		<p>Extra note: this web application can also be used as a live polling/querying system, as long as you just change "speak" to "vote". :)</p>

		<h4>Version History</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Version 0.03 (2/9/2015)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Added styling! Now it looks much better :)</li>
					<li>Changed general wording from "vote" to "speak" to better match the intended purposes.</li>
					<li>Currently working on functionality for admins to create custom question, description, admin page, etc. so users know what they are submitting for.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Version 0.02 (2/7/2015): 
				<ul>
					<li>Live querying IMPLEMENTED!! Not asynchronous however, since GAE doesn't fully support sockets. </li>
					<ul>
						<li>As a result, the admin page queries every three seconds.</li>
						<li><strong>Note that power is now turned off for each reset.</strong> </li>
						<li>I am currently working on a fix. Fortunately, this will not interfere with whether the admin receives votes.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Added power button to turn on/off the live querying (basically like a real buzzer!).</li>
					<li>Removed refresh button.</li>
					<li>Moved buttons to top so they don't get pushed down as page gets updated.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Version 0.01 (2/6/2015): 
				<ul>
					<li>Added jQuery to frontend to add a refresh button. Asynchronous/live querying is a work in progress.</li>
					<li>Changed radio buttons to yes/no submit buttons on vote page.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Version 0.00 (2/5/2015): 
				<ul>
					<li>Created basic site with login/admin and voting functionality.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
