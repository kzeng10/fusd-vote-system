FUSD Voting Web App

<h3>How it works:</h3>
If you wish to vote, click on the link for the vote page. Enter in your name and whether you want to speak, and hit submit. 
If you wish to moderate the voting, click on the link for the admin page. The page will populate with everyone who sent a request so far. You may refresh the page to update who's voting if someone submits after you load the page. If you want to reset the system, hit reset, and wait for everyone to vote before you refresh the page.
		
		
To do list:
- Keyboard hotkeys for submitting (y for yes and n for no)
- Indicator on vote page for whether system is on or off
- Styling (Katherine/Valerie help)
  - print a count at the bottom
- Login system for voters? Likely unnecessary.
